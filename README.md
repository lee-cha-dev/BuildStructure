# Project Structure Generator

This Python script generates a text-based representation of your project's directory structure, ignoring common development-related directories and files.

## Features

- Generates a hierarchical view of your project's file and directory structure
- Ignores common directories and files (e.g., .git, node_modules, __pycache__)
- Outputs the structure to a text file in a 'structure' directory

## Requirements

- Python 3.8

## Usage

1. Place the `main.py` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Run the script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. The script will create a `structure` directory (if it doesn't exist) and generate a `project_structure.txt` file inside it.

## Output

The generated `project_structure.txt` file will contain a tree-like representation of your project structure, for example:

```
Project Structure (generated on 2024-09-28 12:00:00):

YourProjectName/
├── main.py
├── src/
│   ├── module1.py
│   └── module2.py
└── tests/
    ├── test_module1.py
    └── test_module2.py
```

## Customization

You can modify the `IGNORE_LIST` in the script to add or remove directories and files that should be ignored during the structure generation.

## Note

This script is designed to work with local file systems and may not accurately represent structures in containerized or virtual environments.
